1. Perform command to list all API resources in your Kubernetes cluster, save to resources.csv
2. List linux services associated with kubernetes, then save to services.csv - Yes, that's exactly right. You would use this command when you're logged into a Kubernetes node (whether it's a control plane/master node or a worker node).
3. use declarative synatax to create an example pod, and its associated yaml file. So I was right, you need to run po with dry-run to first create the file, then apply it. 

when using kubectl to create a pod, --dry-run=client what does that mean?
