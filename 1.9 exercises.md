1. Perform command to list all API resources in your Kubernetes cluster, save to resources.csv
2. List linux services associated with kubernetes, then save to services.csv - Yes, that's exactly right. You would use this command when you're logged into a Kubernetes node (whether it's a control plane/master node or a worker node).
3. use declarative synatax to create an example pod, and its associated yaml file. So I was right, you need to run po with dry-run to first create the file, then apply it. 

when using kubectl to create a pod, --dry-run=client what does that mean?

When you use --dry-run=server, your request is actually sent to the Kubernetes API server, but with a special flag that tells the server not to persist any changes. Here's what happens:

The full request is sent to the Kubernetes API server
The API server performs complete validation of your resource definition
The API server checks authorization (whether you have permission to create the resource)
The API server simulates the creation process, including:

Admission controllers processing
Schema validation
Webhook validation


No actual resources are created or modified in the cluster
You receive the same response you would get if the resource had been created

The key difference from --dry-run=client is that --dry-run=server provides a more thorough validation since it goes through the entire server-side validation pipeline, including:

Custom admission controllers
Validating webhooks
Mutating webhooks (you'll see any mutations that would be applied)

This is particularly valuable when you have custom validation logic implemented through admission webhooks, as client-side validation wouldn't catch these potential issues.
It's useful when you want to:

Test if your resource would be accepted by all admission controllers
See how mutating webhooks might modify your resource
Verify you have the proper permissions to create the resource
